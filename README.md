# Client/Server-TCP-Connection
 
## Description
This is a client/server connection that allows ensured communication between the two using a TCP connection coded from scratch. Project was intended to read a text file on client, fill a packet with a max of four characters from text file, send packet to server and wait for acknowledgement packet, repeat the steps until the end-of-file was reached, and recreate a text file on server side that would be identical to the original.
